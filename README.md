# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project Two: Sophia Emanuel and Amanda Liu.

For the first part we worked on creating the Category and Subcategory dataframes. To do this we first found the columns by using .columns on our dataframe. Then we split the 'category & sub-category' by using .str.split and splitting on the / to create seperate columns for categories and subcategories. We then used .unique on both the categories and subcategories to find each of the unique values and then found the amount of disticnt values that we have. We then used np.arange from 1-10 for categories and 1-25 for subcategories inorder to create an numpy array. With this array, we created a list comprehension to add cat to each category id and subcat to each subcategory and then put each of these into their own dataframe, being named category_df and subcategory_df. With this, we exported these as CSV files into the resources file as files named 'category.csv' and 'subcategory.csv'

For the second part we created a Campaign dataframe. To do this we first copied the crowdfunding_info_df dataframe and then renamed the column blurb to description, launched_at to launched_date, and deadline to end_date. Then, we used .dtypes to check the tyes in our campaign types and used .astype(float) to change goal and pledged from int64 to float types. Then we changed launched_date and end_date to datetime format by using pd.to_datetime and .dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') to change to a year-month-day format. With our converted data we then merged our campaign and category dataframes on category and then merged our first merge with our subcategory dataframe on subcategory. We then dropped the unwanted columns by using .drop and axis=1 to drop the labels. Finally, we exported the cleaned dataframe into a csvfile in the resources file under the name 'campaign.csv.'
